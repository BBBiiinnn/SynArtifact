{"Model Type": "Stable Diffusion 2.1-v", "Dataset": "Midjourney", "Prompt": "Create a 4x4 sprite sheet of 16 weapons without any background. The weapons should be created in a realistic RPG game style, and the list of weapons you should include are: longsword, battle axe, spear, halberd, flail, crossbow, war hammer, bow and arrow, pike, dagger, war club, javelin, morningstar, quarterstaff, catapult. To create the sprite sheet, you'll need to first research and study the medieval weapons to understand their design and functionality. Once you have a good understanding, you can begin creating the weapons in a realistic RPG game style, paying attention to the details such as the materials used, the shape and size, and any embellishments or decorations. To ensure consistency across all weapons, you may want to create a basic template or outline for each weapon before adding in the finer details. This can include the overall shape and size, the grip, the blade or head, and any additional features such as spikes or chains. Once you've created all 16 weapons, you can arrange them in a 4x4 grid where each weapon is 256x256 pixels larget on a transparent background to create the final sprite sheet. Make sure each weapon is clearly visible and recognizable, with no overlapping or blending with neighboring weapons.", "Image path": "sub_data_1/images/000000873.png", "Artifacts annotation": [], "Other artifacts caption": "deformed objects, deformed texture", "T2I misalignment caption": "error counting", "Aesthetics score": 0.5}
