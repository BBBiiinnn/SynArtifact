{"Model Type": "DALLE 3", "Dataset": "Users", "Prompt": "Childlike digital drawing with a focus on crisp autumn leaves, inspired by Van Eyck's oil paintings: In a forest filled with bright, hand-drawn leaves, a spirit resembling a friendly ghost sits atop a pile of leaves, sharing tales with cartoonish animals.
