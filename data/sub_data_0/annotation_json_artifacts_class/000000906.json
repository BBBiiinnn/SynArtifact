{"Model Type": "Stable Diffusion 2.1-v", "Dataset": "Midjourney", "Prompt": "A romantic photograph of a married couple lying in a tranquil lake at night, surrounded by beautiful flowers floating on the water's surface. The image was taken with a Sony A7R IV camera and a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, using a tripod and a remote shutter release to capture a long exposure. The camera settings were carefully calibrated to balance the ambient light and the brightness of the flowers, creating a soft and dreamy effect. The couple is positioned in the center of the frame, their bodies intertwined, their faces illuminated by the light of the stars and the distant city skyline. The flowers, arranged in a circular pattern around the couple, provide a colorful and romantic backdrop, adding to the overall sense of intimacy and beauty. The water is calm and still, creating a mirror-like reflection of the couple and the flowers, adding a sense of serenity and peacefulness to the scene. The photograph captures a moment of love and connection between two people, surrounded by the beauty and magic of nature, inviting the viewer to immerse themselves in the romantic atmosphere and feel the joy and happiness that emanates from the image. ar 16:9 v 5", "Image path": "sub_data_0/images/000000906.png", "Artifacts annotation": [{"rect_start": [156, 241], "rect_end": [453, 436], "artifacts_caption": "The married couple is distorted and duplicated components are generated.", "artifacts_class": "2"}], "Other artifacts caption": "None", "T2I misalignment caption": "The generated image does not show the light of the stars and the distant city skyline.", "Aesthetics score": 0.5}
