{"Model Type": "Stable Diffusion 2.1-v", "Dataset": "Midjourney", "Prompt": "Generate an image of a 6-year-old Cuban with prosthetic legs and arms, seriously practicing swordfighting with an iron pipe on the rooftop of a slum in the Star Wars universe. The Cuban child is wearing an improvised armor made of leather and metal scraps, adding to their appearance of a warrior. In the image, the child should be holding the iron pipe, which represents their sword, high over their head, at a 45-degree angle to the back. The Cuban child should have a determined expression on their face, with sweat on their forehead, and a fierce look in their eyes, indicating their readiness for battle. In the background, the remains of a great battle between ships and tanks that took place 3 years ago can be seen scattered around. The slum in the background should have a desolate and ruined look, with damaged buildings and rubble lying around. The sky should be filled with smoke and debris, indicating that the battle took place not too long ago. The Cuban child should be standing on a wooden plank, with a makeshift roof over their head, while practicing their sword fighting moves. The prosthetic legs and arms should be visible in the image, showing the child's resilience and determination to keep fighting despite their disabilities.", "Image path": "sub_data_2/images/000000806.png", "Artifacts annotation": [{"rect_start": [196, 232], "rect_end": [311, 328], "artifacts_caption": "blurred hands", "artifacts_class": 11}], "Other artifacts caption": "None", "T2I misalignment caption": "None", "Aesthetics score": 0}
