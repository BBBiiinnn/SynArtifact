{"Model Type": "Stable Diffusion 2.1-v", "Dataset": "Midjourney", "Prompt": "Create a book cover illustration that represents the concepts of the mind and persuasion, drawing inspiration from the artistic style of Jacqueline Casey. The image should be in portrait orientation, with dimensions typical for a book cover and a white background. Incorporate Casey's signature minimalist and modernist design approach, utilizing bold typography and geometric shapes to symbolize the intricate relationship between the human mind, cognitive processes, and the art of persuasion. Use a limited color palette and clean lines to convey the sense of mental manipulation, influence, and the power of persuasive techniques. The illustration should be visually engaging and thought-provoking, encouraging readers to explore the content within the book.", "Image path": "sub_data_2/images/000000909.png", "Artifacts annotation": [], "Other artifacts caption": "None", "T2I misalignment caption": "None", "Aesthetics score": 0.9}
